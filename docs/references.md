# Project References

Essential references for R Shiny:

- [Shiny for R](https://shiny.posit.co/r)
- [Shiny Functions](https://shiny.posit.co/r/reference/shiny/latest/)

## Development

Development of the R package will adhere to guidelines from [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), [R for Data Science (2nd ed.)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) and [Mastering Shiny by Hadley Wickham](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html).

Some tidyverse packages to follow when developing R code:

- Dataframes should be generated using [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org)
- Data manipulation should be performed with [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org)
- More complex functions like mapping should use [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org)

## Figures and Tables

Tables should be made with the package `gt`.
A good reference of using `gt` is [gt cookbook by Thomas Mock](https://themockup.blog/static/resources/gt-cookbook.html).

Some additional packages to consider with `gt` include:

- [gtExtras](https://jthomasmock.github.io/gtExtras/)

Plots should be generated with the tidyverse package, `ggplot`.

- [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)
